Things necessary

Arduino UNO R3

USB cable A male - B male (If your computer's USB port is Type A.
If not, change the A male side to a type that can be inserted into
your computer's USB port.)
bread board
Jumper

Motor FA-130 (with cord, especially MABUCHI MOTOR FA-130RA
is good)

Stepping & DC motor drive module using Akizuki Denshi Tsusho
DRV8835

*Soldering is required

Variable resistor or semi-fixed resistor 100kΩ B curve (Actually,
anything from 1kΩ to 100kΩ can be used.)

Battery box for AA x 2 (convenient with a switch)
2 AA batteries

Propellers (red and blue sets for about 300 yen are available at
home centers, model stores, and electronic parts stores)
Motor reverberation material 
(Since it is difficult to hear the sound
of the motor alone, using double-sided tape to attach it to an
appropriate reverberation material such as a paper cup, steel can,
tin can, Tupperware, or desk will make the sound overwhelmingly
easier to hear. We recommend the bottom of a tin can or steel can
for .The texture of the sound changes considerably depending on
the material, so it is interesting to try various things.)
